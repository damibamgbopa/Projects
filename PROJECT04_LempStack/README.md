## Introduction to LEMP Stack

In the previous project, we explored the LAMP Stack, and now it's time to delve into the LEMP Stack. Understanding this stack is crucial for web development, as it comprises Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP, offering a powerful combination for hosting web applications.

### What is LEMP Stack?

The LEMP Stack is a collection of open-source software that works seamlessly together to host web applications. Unlike the LAMP Stack, which uses Apache, the LEMP Stack utilizes Nginx as its web server. This difference brings its own set of advantages, particularly in terms of performance and scalability.
